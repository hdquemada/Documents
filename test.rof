Some Bell Labs localisms are not implemented by default. However, if you call the otherwise 
undocumented SC section-header macro, you will enable implementations of three other archaic Bell Labs 
macros: UC, P1, and P2. These are not enabled by default because (a)~they were not documented, in the 
original ms manual, and (b)~the P1 and UC macros both collide with different macros in the Berkeley 
version of ms. These emulations are sufficient to give back the 1976 Kernighan~& Cherry paper 
Typsetting Mathematics - User's Guide its section headings, and restore some text that had gone missing 
as arguments of undefined macros. No warranty express or implied is given as to how well the 
typographic details these produce match the original Bell Labs macros.
